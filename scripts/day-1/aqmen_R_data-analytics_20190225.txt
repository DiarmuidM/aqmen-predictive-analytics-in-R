# Data Analytics in R #

# Exploratory Data Analysis #

# It is good practice to quickly and systematically explore your data in order to understand what possibilities there are
# for analysis. This process is commonly known as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and involves transforming (summarsing existing
# variables, creating new ones, filtering observations etc), visualising (producing plots) and modelling (building simple statistical 
# models) your data. Grolemund and Wickham (2017) describe EDA as follows:
#	1. Generate questions about your data.
#	2. Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and modelling your data.
#	3. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.
# EDA is NOT a substitute for employing an appropriate research design (i.e. you are not 'fishing' for research questions or statistical significance).

# Some tips of what to look for when performing EDA:
#	- how are the values of your variables distributed? 
#	- which values are most common? Which are most rare? Are there clusters in your data?
#	- are there gaps in the values of a variable?
#	- how do the values of two variables covary?
#	- what process could generate patterns between two variables? Random chance?
#	- how strong is the association between two variables? In what direction does it point? Does the pattern hold when you look at subpopulations?
